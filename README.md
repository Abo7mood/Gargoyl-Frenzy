## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

The **NFT Runner Game** was born out of my passion for both game development and blockchain technology. As a solo project, I aimed to combine the excitement of **endless runner mechanics** with the competitive aspect of **leaderboards** and the innovation of **NFT integration**.

This journey started as an experiment, a way to push my skills further and explore the possibilities of digital ownership within gaming. The development process was challenging, especially implementing **real-time leaderboards** and **blockchain elements**, but I was determined to make it work.

The result? A game where players don’t just run endlessly but compete with real stakes—every achievement, every high score, every record-breaking moment can be tied to an NFT reward, making their progress in the game **truly theirs**.

Looking back, this project reflects my growth as a game developer and my vision for integrating new technologies into gaming. 🚀
